# Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection

The purpose of this project is to detect the fraudulent transactions with some classification models.

## Description

A typical organization loses an estimated 5% of its yearly revenue to fraud, not just the banks but most of the business with a digital platform to pay. Of course, the customers want to be ensured that they wonâ€™t be charged for the items they did not purchase. 
To decrease this issue we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are. We will use supervised learning algorithms (Classification) to detect fraudulent behavior similar to past ones. Moreover, in fraud analytics we have to deal with highly imbalanced datasets when classifying fraud versus non-fraud.
